# dataVis_persistentPoverty

In this folder I have included a PDF of my completed notebook, the raw data file (Persistent Poverty in the UK and EU, 2017), and an ipynb file which can be run through Jupyter (I used the Anaconda distribution). 

This was a project which I did for university, and it ended up being the highest scoring peice (with 85%). 

I created visualisation graphs to highlight correlations and trends. I also explained why I used each graph, and tried to include as many of the techniques I'd learned. I finished with an analysis of what each comparison showed.
