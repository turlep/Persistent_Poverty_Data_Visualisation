# data_visualisation-persistent_poverty

Using visualisation graphs and charts, I highlighted correlations and trends within my dataset. I also explained why I used each graph, and tried to include as many techniques as I could. I finished each visualisation with an analysis of what each comparison showed. This was a python project which I did as part of my university course, and it ended up being one of the highest scoring pieces.

In this folder I have included a PDF of my completed notebook, the raw data file (Persistent Poverty in the UK and EU 2017, from the Office of National Statistics), and an ipynb file which can be run through Jupyter (I used the Anaconda distribution).
